# IoT-packets-classification
classify packets to mqtt/coap/amqp protocols
This parser was a part of my senior thesis project.
The parser reads any pcap file and classify them into 3 categories, creating corresponding csv files.
Each file has significant characteristics for each category such as the size of the payload, the payload ratio, the difference in time between icoming packets and other important attributes.
